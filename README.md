# Random forests

Random forests algorithms are used for classification and regression. The random forest is an ensemble learning method, composed of multiple decision trees. By averaging out the impact of several decision trees, random forests tend to improve prediction.

Random forests tend to shine in scenarios where a model has a large number of features that individually have weak predicative power but much stronger power collectively.
